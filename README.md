# Five-Stage-RISC-V-Processor
Fully functioning five stage pipelined RISC-V processor with full bypassing/forwarding written from scratch using Verilog. Functionality was verified in simulation as well as in hardware through deployment on a Xilinx PYNQ FPGA board. Design was first implemented as a single cycle processor and then modified to incorporate pipelining, forwarding, and stalling.
